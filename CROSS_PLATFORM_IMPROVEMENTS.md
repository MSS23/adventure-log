# Cross-Platform Improvements

## Platform Detection & Utilities

### Enhanced Platform Detection (`src/lib/utils/platform.ts`)
- Added comprehensive runtime platform detection for web, iOS, and Android
- Capability checking for camera, geolocation, filesystem, share, and toast features
- Device information gathering including screen dimensions and touch support
- Standalone mode detection for PWA and native apps

### Native API Wrapper (`src/lib/utils/native.ts`)
- Unified API for camera, geolocation, sharing, file system, and notifications
- Automatic fallbacks from native APIs to web APIs
- Cross-platform permission management
- Error handling with platform-specific messaging

## Storage & State Management

### Cross-Platform Storage (`src/lib/utils/cross-platform-storage.ts`)
- Unified storage API using localStorage for web and Capacitor Preferences for native
- Memory fallback when platform storage fails
- React hooks for seamless storage integration
- JSON serialization/deserialization support

### Theme Management (`src/lib/contexts/ThemeContext.tsx`)
- Cross-platform theme detection and storage
- Capacitor Preferences integration for native theme persistence
- Safe area handling for mobile devices
- System theme detection with fallbacks

## Progressive Web App Enhancements

### Enhanced PWA Manager (`src/lib/utils/pwa.ts`)
- Platform-aware initialization (PWA features only on web)
- Capacitor Network plugin integration for native network detection
- Cross-platform offline data storage
- Background sync capabilities for web platform

## Mobile Build System

### Improved Mobile Build Script (`scripts/build-mobile.js`)
- Mobile-optimized loading screen with safe area support
- Better error handling and retry mechanisms
- Platform-specific configurations
- Automated asset optimization

### Next.js Configuration (`next.config.ts`)
- Mobile build detection and optimization
- Image optimization settings per platform
- Security headers for web deployment
- Environment-specific configurations

## Package Dependencies

### Added Capacitor Plugins
- `@capacitor/network` - Network status monitoring
- Enhanced existing plugins for better cross-platform support

## Application Manifest

### Mobile Manifest (`src/app/api/manifest/route.ts`)
- Platform-aware manifest generation
- Mobile-optimized icons and screenshots
- App shortcuts for native platforms
- PWA installation prompts

## Best Practices Implemented
