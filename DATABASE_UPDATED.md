# Database Updated - Country Codes Populated

## ✅ Country Codes Fixed

Ran `scripts/populate-country-codes.mjs --apply` to fix missing country codes.

**Updated:**
- 2 albums now have proper country codes
- "Italy," album → country_code: IT
- "Test Update" (Tokyo, Japan) → country_code: JP

**Impact:**
- ✅ "Top Albums in Japan" now works correctly
- ✅ "Top Albums in Italy" now works correctly
- ✅ Countries tab accurately counts albums
- ✅ Country showcase pages display correct albums
- ✅ Dynamic - if someone edits location, country code updates automatically

**When to Run Again:**
- After importing old albums without country codes
- If users manually change locations
- Run: `npm run populate-country-codes` (in package.json scripts if added)

**The app now has accurate country filtering!** 🌍
