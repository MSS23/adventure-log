## 🔍 Verification Commands

Run these in Supabase SQL Editor to verify setup:

```sql
-- Check all tables exist
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public' ORDER BY table_name;

-- Check storage buckets
SELECT name, public FROM storage.buckets;

-- Check if profiles can be created
SELECT COUNT(*) as profile_count FROM profiles;

-- Check countries data
SELECT COUNT(*) as country_count FROM countries;
```

Expected results:
- **Tables**: ~15-20 tables including profiles, albums, photos, likes, comments
- **Buckets**: `photos` and `avatars` both public
- **Profiles**: Should show count without errors
- **Countries**: Should show ~20 countries

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Still getting profile errors?
```sql
-- Check if trigger exists
SELECT trigger_name FROM information_schema.triggers
WHERE event_object_table = 'users';
```

### Storage upload failures?
```sql
-- Check bucket policies
SELECT * FROM storage.objects LIMIT 1;
```

### Environment variable issues?
- Visit: `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/health`
- Should return: `{"status": "healthy", "timestamp": "..."}`
