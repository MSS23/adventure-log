## 📋 Quick Start Guide

### 1. Apply Database Migration

```bash
# Navigate to Supabase SQL Editor
# Paste and run: database/migrations/09_privacy_playlists_offline.sql
```

### 2. Test Privacy Controls

```typescript
// In album form, add:
<AlbumPrivacyControls
  onPrivacyChange={(settings) => updateAlbum(settings)}
/>
```

### 3. Access Playlists

```
Navigate to: /playlists
- Create a new playlist
- Add albums to it
- Make it public
- Test subscribing from another account
```

### 4. Test Offline Mode

```
1. Open DevTools → Network tab
2. Set to "Offline"
3. Create an album
4. Check upload_queue table
5. Go back "Online"
6. Watch automatic sync
```

---

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### Privacy Defaults

Change default privacy level in migration:

```sql
ALTER TABLE albums 
ALTER COLUMN location_precision 
SET DEFAULT 'neighbourhood';
```

### Playlist Categories

Edit in `/playlists/page.tsx`:

```typescript
const categories = [
  'food', 'nature', 'architecture', 
  'adventure', 'beaches', 'nightlife'
]
```

### Upload Retry Settings

Modify in `upload_queue` table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE upload_queue 
ALTER COLUMN max_retries 
SET DEFAULT 5; -- Instead of 3
```
