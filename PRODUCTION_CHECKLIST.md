# Production Deployment Checklist

## ✅ Code Quality & Performance

### Build Status
- ✅ **Build succeeds** - No compilation errors
- ✅ **Zero ESLint warnings** - All linting issues fixed
- ✅ **TypeScript strict mode** - All type errors resolved
- ✅ **No security vulnerabilities** - npm audit shows 0 vulnerabilities

### Bundle Size
- **Current**: 612 kB First Load JS
  - vendor chunk: 561 kB (mostly react-globe.gl, three.js, exifr, jspdf, html2canvas)
  - common chunk: 48.9 kB
  - other shared: 2.01 kB

**Status**: ⚠️ Large but acceptable for feature-rich application

**Optimization Recommendations**:
1. Consider code splitting for globe page (loads three.js only when needed)
2. Lazy load PDF export (jspdf) and screenshot features (html2canvas)
3. Consider lighter EXIF library alternative if only basic metadata needed

## 🗄️ Database

### Required Migrations
**CRITICAL**: Run these SQL migrations in Supabase before deployment:

1. **Cover Photo Positioning** (Required for cover editor feature)
2. **Likes Constraint Fix** (Required for location favorites)

See `SUPABASE_MIGRATIONS_NEEDED.md` for complete SQL scripts.

### Database Indexes
Current indexes are optimized for:
- User lookups by ID
- Album queries by user_id and visibility
- Photo queries by album_id
- Likes and follows queries
- Timeline queries by date

**Status**: ✅ Well-indexed

---

## 🔒 Security

### Authentication
- ✅ Supabase Auth with Row Level Security (RLS)
- ✅ Protected routes with middleware
- ✅ Server-side session validation
- ✅ Secure cookie handling

### Data Protection
- ✅ RLS policies on all tables
- ✅ Users can only modify their own data
- ✅ Privacy levels respected (public/friends/private)
- ✅ Soft deletes with 30-day recovery

### API Security

- [x] Run `npm run lint` - zero warnings
- [x] Run `npm run type-check` - zero errors
- [ ] Run database migrations on Supabase
- [ ] Test authentication flow
- [ ] Test file uploads to Supabase storage
- [ ] Verify storage buckets exist and have correct RLS policies

### Vercel Configuration
- ✅ Next.js 15.5.3 auto-detected
- ✅ Node.js 20.x runtime
- ✅ Build command: `npm run build`
- ✅ Output directory: `.next`
- ✅ Install command: `npm install`

### Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Check homepage loads
- [ ] Test login/signup flow
- [ ] Create a test album
- [ ] Upload photos
- [ ] Test globe visualization
- [ ] Check feed displays correctly
- [ ] Test cover photo position editor
- [ ] Verify mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Check PWA functionality (offline mode)

## 📊 Performance Monitoring

### Core Web Vitals Targets
- **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)**: < 2.5s
- **FID (First Input Delay)**: < 100ms
- **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)**: < 0.1

### Monitoring Endpoints
- `/api/monitoring/web-vitals` - Core Web Vitals tracking
- `/api/monitoring/performance` - Performance metrics
- `/api/monitoring/errors` - Error tracking
- `/api/monitoring/security` - Security events

**Status**: ✅ Monitoring implemented

---

## 🔧 Optimization Opportunities

### Image Optimization
- ✅ Using Next.js Image component with automatic optimization
- ✅ Lazy loading images on feed
- ✅ Blur placeholders for better UX
- ✅ Responsive image sizes with `sizes` prop

### Code Splitting
- ✅ Globe component dynamically imported (`ssr: false`)
- ⚠️ Consider lazy loading: PDF export, Excel export, HTML2Canvas

### Caching Strategy
- ✅ Profile data cached (5min TTL)
- ✅ Static assets cached with immutable headers
- ✅ Service worker for offline functionality
- ✅ Vercel Edge CDN caching

---

## 🐛 Known Issues & Workarounds

### 1. THREE.Color Warnings
**Status**: Non-critical - Library issue
**Impact**: Console warnings only, no functional impact
**Action**: None required

### 2. User Levels Table (Optional)
**Status**: Table doesn't exist - feature disabled
**Impact**: Gamification system not active
**Action**: Run migration only if needed

### 3. Albums with Missing Profiles
**Status**: Already handled
**Impact**: Albums filtered out automatically
**Action**: None required - working as intended
