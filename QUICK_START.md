## Step 2: Test Privacy Controls ⏱️ 1 minute

Navigate to your album creation page and the privacy controls are already integrated:

## Step 4: Test Offline Mode ⏱️ 1 minute

1. Open DevTools (F12) → **Network** tab
2. Set to **"Offline"** 
3. Try creating an album
4. Notice it queues successfully
5. Go back **"Online"**
6. Watch it auto-sync! ✨

Check the sync indicator in the top navigation (near your profile).

## ✅ That's It!

All three features are now working:

- 🔒 **Privacy**: Albums can hide location & delay posting
- 🎵 **Playlists**: Create and share curated collections  
- 📦 **Offline**: Queue uploads, sync automatically

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Migration Failed?

**Error: "relation already exists"**
- Tables already created - you're good! ✅

**Error: "function does not exist"**  
- Re-run just the function definitions from the migration

**Error: "permission denied"**
- Check you're using the Supabase service role
- Or run as authenticated user with appropriate grants

### Playlists Page 404?

Make sure the file exists:
```
src/app/(app)/playlists/page.tsx
```

If not, the file was created - check your file system.

### Components Not Found?

Restart your dev server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

### TypeScript Errors?

Restart TypeScript server in VS Code:
```
Cmd+Shift+P (Mac) / Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows)
> TypeScript: Restart TS Server
```
