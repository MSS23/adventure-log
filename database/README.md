# Adventure Log Database Setup - Production Ready

This directory contains the **robust, production-ready** database schema for Adventure Log. All schema conflicts have been resolved and the files are optimized for future extensibility.

## 🚀 Quick Setup

**Execute these 4 files in order:**

```bash
# 1. Core schema and tables
psql -f 01-core-schema.sql

# 2. Minimal reference data (4 essential countries only)
psql -f 02-reference-data.sql

# 3. Enhanced features and views
psql -f 03-enhanced-features.sql

# 4. Business logic functions
psql -f 04-functions-and-views.sql
```

## 📋 Execution Order (CRITICAL)

| Order | File | Purpose | Dependencies |
|-------|------|---------|--------------|
| **1** | `01-core-schema.sql` | Core tables, RLS, triggers | None |
| **2** | `02-reference-data.sql` | Minimal reference data (4 countries) | 01-core-schema |
| **3** | `03-enhanced-features.sql` | Views, indexes, optimizations | 01, 02 |
| **4** | `04-functions-and-views.sql` | Business logic functions | 01, 02, 03 |

## 🔧 Key Improvements

### Schema Conflicts Resolved
- ✅ **Unified cities table** structure (no more country_id vs country_code conflicts)
- ✅ **Consolidated social features** (removed duplicate likes/comments tables)
- ✅ **Proper foreign key relationships** throughout
- ✅ **No more circular dependencies**

### Performance Optimizations
- ✅ **Strategic indexes** for common queries
- ✅ **Denormalized country_code** for performance

- ✅ **Flight path caching** for animations

### Future-Proof Design
- ✅ **Extensible location system** (cities, islands, coordinates)
- ✅ **Flexible social features** (target_type pattern)
- ✅ **Comprehensive constraints** prevent bad data
- ✅ **ON CONFLICT handling** for safe re-runs

## 📊 Database Schema Overview

### Core Tables (15 total)
```
countries (4 essential countries: US, GB, CA, AU)
├── cities (empty - dynamically populated by users)
├── islands (empty - dynamically populated by users)
└── profiles (user accounts)
    ├── albums (travel albums with location data)
    │   └── photos (with EXIF and location metadata)
    ├── followers (social networking)
    ├── likes (flexible likes system)
    ├── comments (flexible comments system)
    ├── user_travel_stats (derived analytics)
    ├── travel_timeline (chronological travel data)
    ├── travel_statistics (per-year analytics)
    └── flight_paths (cached route calculations)
```

### Key Views (6 total)
- `travel_timeline_view` - Enhanced timeline for animations
- `travel_animation_data` - Optimized for frontend consumption
- `user_dashboard_stats` - Complete user statistics
- `travel_years_summary` - Travel activity by year
- `popular_destinations` - Cross-user destination analytics
- `user_social_feed` - Social media feed for followed users

### Business Logic Functions (13 total)
- **Search**: `search_cities()`, `search_islands()`
- **Analytics**: `get_user_dashboard_stats()`, `get_user_travel_years()`
- **Calculations**: `calculate_distance()`, `calculate_travel_statistics()`
- **Maintenance**: `refresh_all_travel_data()`, `validate_travel_data_integrity()`

## 🗑️ Deprecated Files

The following files have been **consolidated** and are no longer needed:

❌ `database-setup.sql` → Merged into 01-core-schema.sql
❌ `fix-profile-creation.sql` → Included in 01-core-schema.sql
❌ `fix-runtime-errors.sql` → Issues resolved in consolidated files
❌ `apply-enhanced-schema.sql` → Split between 03 and 04
❌ `social-features-schema.sql` → Merged into 01-core-schema.sql
❌ `travel-animation-schema.sql` → Split between 01, 03, and 04
❌ `world-cities-data.sql` → Improved and merged into 02-reference-data.sql
❌ `enhanced-schema-updates.sql` → Consolidated into new files

## 🔍 Verification

After running all files, verify the setup:

```sql
-- Check table count (should be 15+)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_type = 'BASE TABLE';

-- Check data integrity
SELECT * FROM validate_travel_data_integrity();

-- Verify reference data
SELECT
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM countries) as countries, -- Should be 4
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cities) as cities,       -- Should be 0 (empty)
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM islands) as islands;     -- Should be 0 (empty)
```

## 💡 Usage Examples

```sql
-- Search for cities
SELECT * FROM search_cities('tokyo', 5);

-- Get user travel statistics
SELECT * FROM get_user_dashboard_stats('user-uuid-here');

-- Get popular destinations
SELECT * FROM get_popular_destinations(10);

-- Calculate distance between two points
SELECT calculate_distance(40.7128, -74.0060, 51.5074, -0.1278) as nyc_to_london_km;
```

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Execute in order** - Files have dependencies
2. **Safe to re-run** - All files use proper conflict handling
3. **Production ready** - Includes RLS, constraints, and security
4. **Future extensible** - Designed for easy feature additions
5. **Performance optimized** - Strategic indexes and caching
