-- Migration: Cleanup Orphaned Data
-- Identifies and optionally removes albums and photos without valid user profiles

-- ============================================
-- PART 2: OPTIONAL CLEANUP (COMMENTED OUT)
-- Uncomment these sections if you want to delete orphaned data
-- ============================================

-- OPTION A: Soft delete orphaned albums (recommended - allows recovery)
-- UPDATE albums
-- SET deleted_at = NOW()
-- WHERE user_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM users)
-- AND deleted_at IS NULL;

-- OPTION B: Hard delete orphaned albums (permanent - use with caution)
-- DELETE FROM albums
-- WHERE user_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM users);

-- OPTION C: Delete orphaned photos
-- DELETE FROM photos
-- WHERE album_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM albums);

-- ============================================
-- PART 3: CREATE FUNCTION TO PREVENT FUTURE ORPHANS
-- ============================================

-- Create a function to check if user exists before album creation
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION check_user_exists_for_album()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE id = NEW.user_id) THEN
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'Cannot create album: user profile does not exist for user_id %', NEW.user_id;
  END IF;

-- Create trigger to enforce user existence check
