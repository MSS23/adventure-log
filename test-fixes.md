# Testing Report for Adventure Log Fixes

## Test Date: 2025-10-28

## 1. "Suggested for you" See All Results Fix

### Issue
When clicking "See all" on the suggested users section in the feed page, it was showing no results.

### Solution Applied
1. Updated the "See all" link in `/src/app/(app)/feed/page.tsx` to include a `mode=suggested` query parameter
2. Modified `/src/components/search/AdvancedSearch.tsx` to handle the `suggested` mode
3. Added special logic to fetch and display suggested users similar to the SuggestedUsers component logic
4. Added a title "Suggested for you" in the search page when in suggested mode

### Changes Made:
- **File:** `src/app/(app)/feed/page.tsx` (Line 429)
  - Changed: `href="/search"` to `href="/search?mode=suggested"`

- **File:** `src/components/search/AdvancedSearch.tsx`
  - Added handling for `mode=suggested` parameter
  - Implemented suggested users fetching logic based on:
    - Users who visited similar countries
    - Friends of friends
    - Popular users as fallback

- **File:** `src/app/(app)/search/page.tsx`
  - Added title display for suggested users mode

### Testing Steps:
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/feed
2. Look for "Suggested for you" section in the right sidebar
3. Click "See All" link
4. Verify that the search page shows "Suggested for you" title
5. Verify that suggested users are displayed

## 2. Top Spot Logic Fix

### Issue
"Top Spot" was showing the most frequently visited location rather than the most popular (by likes).

### Solution Applied
Updated the Top Spot calculation in `/src/app/(app)/feed/page.tsx` to:
1. Calculate total likes per location
2. Sort locations by total likes first
3. Use visit count as tiebreaker
4. Fall back to most recent location if no likes exist

### Changes Made:
- **File:** `src/app/(app)/feed/page.tsx` (Lines 537-569)
  - Replaced simple frequency counting with popularity scoring
  - Added likes aggregation per location
  - Implemented multi-level sorting (likes, then count)
  - Added fallback to most recent if no likes

### Algorithm:
```javascript
1. Create Map<location, {count, likes}>
2. For each album with location:
   - Increment location count
   - Add album.likes_count to location likes
3. Sort by:
   - Primary: Total likes (descending)
   - Secondary: Visit count (descending)
4. If top location has likes > 0: show it
5. Else: show most recent location
```

### Testing Steps:
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/feed
2. Look at the "Top Spot" widget in the Community Highlights section
3. Verify it shows the location with most total likes
4. Like some albums from different locations
5. Refresh and verify Top Spot updates based on likes

## Summary

Both issues have been successfully fixed:

✅ **Suggested Users "See All"**: Now properly displays suggested users when clicking "See all"
✅ **Top Spot Logic**: Now shows the most popular location by likes instead of just frequency

The fixes maintain backward compatibility and handle edge cases like:
- Users not logged in (shows popular users)
- No likes exist (falls back to most recent)
- No suggested users available (shows popular users)
