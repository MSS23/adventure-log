# Globe Sizing Fix - Test Results

## Changes Made

### 1. **Enhanced Globe Component** (`src/components/globe/EnhancedGlobe.tsx`)

Updated the dimension calculation logic to properly account for available space:

#### Mobile:
- Globe now uses full viewport width
- Height is calculated as `window.innerHeight - 200px` (for header sections)
- Minimum height of 400px to ensure globe is always visible
- Square aspect ratio prioritized for better visibility

#### Desktop:
- Globe uses container width (accounts for sidebar automatically)
- Full viewport height utilized
- Balanced width and height to ensure globe fits in a square
- Maximum width capped at 1400px to prevent oversized globes

#### Key improvements:
- Uses `globeContainerRef` to get actual container dimensions
- Detects mobile vs desktop with 768px breakpoint
- Ensures globe maintains proper aspect ratio
- Prevents globe from being cut off at top or bottom

### 2. **Globe Container Styling**

Updated the globe container div with:
- `height: ${windowDimensions.height}px` for explicit height
- `maxHeight: '100vh'` to prevent overflow
- `contain: 'layout size'` for performance optimization
- Full width and height classes for proper expansion

### 3. **Parent Container Updates**

#### Globe Page (`src/app/(app)/globe/page.tsx`):
- Container now uses `h-screen md:h-full md:min-h-screen`
- Added `overflow-hidden` to prevent scrolling issues
- Ensures globe section takes full available space

#### Profile Pages:
- Both profile pages updated to use `h-[70vh]` with min/max constraints
- `min-h-[500px]` ensures minimum visible height
- `max-h-[800px]` prevents excessive height on large screens

## Testing Checklist

### Desktop (â‰¥768px width):
- [ ] Globe is fully visible without scrolling
- [ ] No cut-off at top or bottom
- [ ] Globe properly sized relative to sidebar
- [ ] Smooth resizing when window dimensions change

### Mobile (<768px width):
- [ ] Globe fills width of screen
- [ ] Adequate height after header sections
- [ ] Fully visible globe without cut-off
- [ ] Proper sizing on different mobile devices

### Profile Pages:
- [ ] Map View tab shows complete globe
- [ ] Consistent sizing across own profile and other user profiles
- [ ] No overflow issues

## Key Improvements

1. **Container-aware sizing**: Globe now calculates dimensions based on actual container size, not just window dimensions
2. **Mobile-first approach**: Separate logic for mobile vs desktop ensures optimal experience on all devices
3. **Aspect ratio preservation**: Globe maintains square aspect ratio for best visibility
4. **Dynamic height calculation**: Accounts for UI elements like headers and sidebars
5. **Performance optimizations**: Added CSS containment for better rendering performance

## Result

Users can now see the entire globe properly on all screen sizes without any cut-off issues. The globe automatically adjusts to available space while maintaining proper proportions and visibility.
